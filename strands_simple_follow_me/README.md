## Follow me
This package provides a simple node that uses the pedestrian tracker results from the strands_perception_people repository to follow the closest person in front of the robot.
In order to use it you have to run scitos_2d_nav.launch from the scitos_2d_navigation repository with a pre-recorded or empty map. After words run the perception_people_launch pedestrian_tracker_no_HOG.launch and this node on the robot.
